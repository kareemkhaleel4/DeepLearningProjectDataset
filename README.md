In this project, I have the following files:

1- 00001-baseline-model.ipynb: A notebook where I have run the final examples for this project

2- 00002-StateOfArt-model.ipynb: A notebook where I have used the same data with different state-of-the-art models to get results

3-utils.py: a collection of the functions and classes that I used in my work. It was created for the notebook examples, other files have the same implementations inside them

4- baseline_model_cnn.py: The models that I have run initially, and have the code and transformers

5- initial_test.py: a file that contains the initial examples and work that I have done

6- tuning_model.py: the file where I did the tuning of the parameters and generated some images

7- Deep_learning_project_paper_kareem_khaleel.pdf: the report I wrote about this research

8- FETAL_PLANES_DB_data.csv: dataset information

9- Images: the images directory: please note that this is empty now, since the data size is 2 GB, but I will provide a GitHub link where you can access the full project including the images.

10 data and data_t: folders for split data between training and testing. this was used for initial testing
